>Hi there! My name is Joel Masselink.
Hi there! I'm Joel and I am a geospatial specialist and consultant based in [Seattle, Washington](/maps/leaflet-map.html). For a few years now, I have had a small consulting business called **Earth Logic LLC** which allows me to work closely with clients like conservation nonprofits, archaeology companies, and  on curating geospatial data and developing tools for their projects.

>I have previously worked for [**Vulcan**](http://www.vulcan.com/technology)'s Impact Engineering team (also in Seattle)  and for [**Wildlife Conservation Society**](http://www.wcs.org) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

>I am a proud member of [OpenStreetMap US](http://openstreetmap.us) and the [Society for Conservation GIS](http://scgis.org).
>I enjoy working on MissingMaps / Humanitarian OpenStreetMap projects, open source GIS, and Python scripting.  

>To this point in my career, my work relates to geospatial data and mapping, mostly in the international conservation sector. Check out my [resume](resume.md) for more details about my career.

>In my spare time, I volunteer for [**Tusubira**](http://www.tusubira.org), a nonprofit organization which supports education and women's empowerment in eastern Uganda. My role is Treasurer and fundraising.

>Outside of work, I like to travel, cat-sit, watch birds, read, exercise, and watch sports.


Lately, I've enjoyed working on OpenStreetMap and contributing my geographic knowledge to the OSM platform - a free, editable, and usable map of the world.
