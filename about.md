>Hi there! My name is Joel Masselink and I am a geospatial specialist. For a few years now, I have worked as an independent consultant with my consulting business [**Earth Logic LLC**](/earthlogic). Consulting allows me to work closely with clients like conservation nonprofits, companies, and international development organizations on curating geospatial data and developing customized solutions for their projects.

#### My Career
>
>I previously worked for [Vulcan](http://www.vulcan.com/technology)'s Impact Engineering team (also in Seattle) on the [Great Elephant Census](http://www.greatelephantcensus.com) and [EarthRanger](https://www.earthranger.com) projects, and for [Wildlife Conservation Society](http://www.wcs.org) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. My work has involved managing, analyzing, and visualizing massive datasets related to wildlife surveys, and protected area geospatial data.

>Check out my [resume](resume.md) for more details about my career.

>I enjoy using Mapbox developer-centered tools and I am newly registered with the [Mapbox Developer Network](https://www.mapbox.com/developer-network/developers/).
>I am a proud member of [OpenStreetMap US](http://openstreetmap.us) and the [Society for Conservation GIS](http://scgis.org).
>I enjoy working on MissingMaps / Humanitarian OpenStreetMap projects, open source GIS, and honing my Python, SQL, R, and JavaScript skills.

#### Volunteering
>
>In my spare time, I am a volunteer board member and treasurer with [**Tusubira**](http://www.tusubira.org), a nonprofit organization which supports education and women's empowerment in eastern Uganda. My role includes bookkeeping, fundraising, and coordinating with our Uganda-based partners.

>Along with a small group of digital humanitarians, I supported LUCHA (*Lutte pour la Changement*), a Congolese pro-democracy and peacemaking network, in deploying [Ushahidi](http://www.ushahidi.com) to monitor election-related abuses.

>Lately, I've enjoyed contributing to [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) - a free, editable, and usable map of the world. Together with a small group of conservationists from MapHubs and Mapbox, we forked the OpenStreetMap tasking manager to organize  environment-focused mapping projects at [OSM.earth](http://osm.earth).

>Additionally, I'm registered on the [MissingMaps Support](https://www.missingmaps.org/host/) page, and ready to assist with corporate mapathons.

#### Outside of work
>
>Outside of work, I like to travel, watch birds, read, exercise, hike, and watch sports. I also enjoy hanging around with my lovely wife, [Carol](http://www.carolbogezi.com), my young daughter, and my old friends.
