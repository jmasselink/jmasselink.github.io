>Hi there! My name is Joel Masselink and I am a geospatial specialist and consultant based in [Seattle, Washington](/maps/seattle-leaflet.html). For a few years now, I have worked as an independent consultant with my small consulting firm called [**Earth Logic LLC**](/earthlogic). Consulting allows me to work closely with clients like conservation nonprofits, archaeology companies, and international development organizations on curating geospatial data and developing specialized tools for their projects.

#### My Career
>I have previously worked for [Vulcan](http://www.vulcan.com/technology)'s Impact Engineering team (also in Seattle) on the [Great Elephant Census](http://www.greatelephantcensus.com) and Domain Awareness System projects, and for [Wildlife Conservation Society](http://www.wcs.org) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. My work has involved managing, analyzing, and visualizing massive datasets related to wildlife surveys, and protected area geospatial data.

>Check out my [resume](resume.md) for more details about my career.

>I enjoy using Mapbox developer-centered tools and I am newly registered with the [Mapbox Developer Network](https://www.mapbox.com/developer-network/developers/).
>I am a proud member of [OpenStreetMap US](http://openstreetmap.us) and the [Society for Conservation GIS](http://scgis.org).
>I enjoy working on MissingMaps / Humanitarian OpenStreetMap projects, open source GIS, and honing my Python, SQL, R, and JavaScript skills.

#### Volunteering
>In my spare time, I volunteer for [**Tusubira**](http://www.tusubira.org), a nonprofit organization which supports education and women's empowerment in eastern Uganda. I am the treasurer and a member of the board so my role includes bookkeeping, fundraising, and coordinating with our Uganda-based partners.

>I'm also part of a small group of digital humanitarians who support LUCHA (*Lutte pour la Changement*), a Congolese pro-democracy and peacemaking network, in deploying [Ushahidi](http://www.ushahidi.com) to monitor election-related abuses.

>Lately, I've enjoyed working on [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) and contributing to the OSM platform - a free, editable, and usable map of the world.

#### Outside of work
>Outside of work, I like to travel, take care of your pets, watch birds, read, exercise, hike, and watch sports. I also like to hang around with my lovely wife, [Carol](http://www.carolbogezi.com) and my old friends.
