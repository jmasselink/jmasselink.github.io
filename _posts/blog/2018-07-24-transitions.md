My job with Vulcan recently ended unceremoniously, with a surprise meeting with HR in which I was informed that my position was being eliminated and it was my last day at Vulcan. I had a good run there for such a chaotic company and gained a great amount of experience as part of an engineering team. This exposed me to the inner workings of software development as a discipline and as a career.

I have decided to restart my consulting practice which was largely dormant for the better part of 3 years. My skillset, interests, network, and future direction are all pointing me towards this. My skillset is a mix of data curation - mostly for large scale wildlife survey data and geospatial data related to protected area boundaries and infrastructure, particularly in eastern and central Africa. My technical interests include data visualization, curation, and storytelling - and learning more technical tools.

My topical focus remains wildlife conservation and international development, and my professional network runs the gamut of geospatial consultants, development professionals, wildlife scientists, digital humanitarians, and nonprofit employees.

My future direction is as not yet charted out but we have some dreams. My best half is an outstanding multidisciplinary wildlife scientist. Together, we can make a powerful team and we look forward to having the opportunity to direct applied conservation research.

There remains loads of work to do in the conservation and environment space and I am betting hard on myself to be able to contribute significantly to efforts of different organizations to address different challenges. Follow along to see where it goes!
